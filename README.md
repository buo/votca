# Unofficial Docker Image for VOTCA

This is an unofficial Docker image for [VOTCA](http://www.votca.org/) with
[GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/).

VOTCA is a software package which focuses on the analysis of molecular dynamics
data, the development of systematic coarse-graining techniques as well as
methods used for simulating microscopic charge and exciton transport in
disordered semiconductors. Its C++ core is interfaced to bash and perl
flow-control scripts.

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the
Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.

## Usage

```
$ docker run -it with/votca
```
